 # Brain Tumor Detection using AI

 This project aims at detecting brain tumor detection using MRI scans of brain. We initially fed the model with set of MRI scan images of the brain with and without having tumor to train the model. The model learns on how to differentiate using several libraries. 

 The project is built on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and the source code with output can be seen at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anilreddya/brain-tumor-detection)

 Also this project can be run on google colab using the same way as kaggle.
